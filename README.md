Useful for me... Maybe useless for you ;) 

I can say that this repo is for a backup-like purpose... If you want take my configs! :)

# Configuration files

  - My own Linux kernel configuration [Linux]
  - .zshrc config file [Z Shell]
  - /etc/pacman.conf and pacman repositories [Pacman package manager ]
  - my i3 environment config [I3]
  - $HOME/.nanorc includes (syntax highlighting) [nano]
  - some scripts... ;)
