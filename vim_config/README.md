## Vim config

Here you are my vim configs
You need to have [VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) in order to install all plugins.

### Install

 * Copy vimrc to $HOME
 ~~~
 ../my_config_files/vim_config $ cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
 ~~~

 * Install vundle
 ~~~
 # follow instruction to the amazing Vundle repository (linked above) 
 ~~~

 * Install plugins
 ~~~
 ~ $ vim +PluginInstall
 ~~~

 Very easy!
